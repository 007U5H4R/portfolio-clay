# Illustration provenance (Design.md §6.2; S20 — EVAL-021, EVAL-013)

One row per manifest id in `manifest.ts`. `sha256` is recorded for the two files that must stay
byte-identical to their disk source (`hero-desk` / the shipped hero poster, E-18); it is left as
"—" for entries where byte-exactness isn't a contract (the re-encoded scenes and the reference
sheet are derived renditions, not byte-exact copies). Spend after Stage 4 was approved by Tushar at the hero gate: 4 credits for two outpaints (`hero-banner`,
`scene-contact`; EXE-15, EXE-19). TKT-105 (2026-09-26): Tushar approved up to 8 more credits to clean the banner's text; 4.25 were spent.

## Re-encoding record (S73.01)

Scenes were re-encoded from the PNG masters in
`/Volumes/E Drive/Dev/Code/Claude/Portfolio-illustration/illustrations/scenes/` with `sharp`
(`jpeg({ quality: 82, mozjpeg: true })`, long edge 2048, no quality step-down needed — all six
landed under the 600 KB cap on the first pass):

| file | quality | bytes | dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scene-work.jpg` | 82 | 300,938 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-casestudy.jpg` | 82 | 437,320 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-about.jpg` | 82 | 350,979 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-thinking.jpg` | 82 | 516,249 | 2048×1529 |
| `scene-playground.jpg` | 82 | 404,203 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-contact.jpg` | 82 | 234,356 | 2048×1143 (16:9 outpaint, EXE-19) |

The reference sheet was re-encoded from `character-ref-LOCKED.png` at quality 90 (no step-down
needed, 536,725 bytes, well under the 1.5 MB cap, 2688×1520).

### TKT-93 · hero banner + clip mask

`hero-banner.webp` was encoded with `sharp` from the outpaint master
(`Portfolio-illustration/animation/export/banner/hero-banner-outpaint-a1.png`, 3168×1344 RGBA, fully
opaque → alpha dropped): `webp({ quality: 86, effort: 6, smartSubsample: true })`, long edge 3168,
**371,142 bytes** (cap 400 kB; q86 was the first quality tried that met it). The clip's feathered
alpha mask `public/media/illustrations/hero-clip-mask.png` (1280×684, **38,998 bytes**, palette PNG)
was built from the prototype's luminance mask (`/Volumes/E Drive/Dev/.scratch/m009/clip-mask-1280.png`,
white = show clip) by writing the luminance into the alpha channel over black — CSS `mask-image`
reads alpha (`mask-mode: match-source`), and the `-webkit-` form is alpha-only. It is not an
illustration (no manifest entry): it carries no picture, only the clip's shape.

### TKT-92 round 2 · narrow-screen banner rendition

`public/media/illustrations/hero-banner-mobile.webp` is a second rendition of `hero-banner` (like the
clip's `.mp4` is of `hero-clip`, so it has no manifest entry of its own): a crop of the same outpaint
master (`hero-banner-outpaint-a1.png`), `removeAlpha().extract({ left: 640, top: 0, width: 1824, height:
1344 })` → `webp({ quality: 86, effort: 6, smartSubsample: true })`, 1824×1344, **210,964 bytes**, sha256
`31e30331c5fb8919d5d68dc1a86b9ccb7078d7dd77650f2b8ca47307d62a1703`. Only the region the < 768 px 4:3
banner box shows (x 0.2072–0.7728 of the scene) plus ≈ 0.5 % a side, so phones download the visible part
only (`<picture>` art direction in `components/paper/SceneBanner.tsx`; placement in `components/hero/Hero.tsx`).
Same pixels, same alt (the `<img>` element is unchanged); no new picture content.

### TKT-105 · text-free banner

Tushar (2026-09-26): *"only leave the book titles … instead of Systems write System Thinking. Remove all other texts."*
The outpaint master was **edited in place, not regenerated**. That keeps the clip registration (scale 1.912, x 362, y 6)
pixel-exact.

1. One `gpt_image_2_5` edit (high quality, 4k, 21:9, **4.25 credits**, job `f32bd259-63f4-499f-bfd2-5f38698e0389`) of the whole
   master, prompted to remove every piece of lettering and retitle the third spine. The output is 3840×1648 and the edit is not pixel-aligned,
   so it is used only as a source of patches.
2. For each text region, the edit was resized to 3168×1344 and aligned on that region's surrounding ring (integer shift, dx ≤ 3,
   dy ≤ 23). It was tone-matched to the original's low frequencies, then composited through a feathered mask of the text strokes. The mask is a box for the spine.
3. For the corkboard notes and papers, and for two small pseudo-lettering marks on the desk (an upside-down "ASI" on a book
   cover and a scribble row on a sketch), the ink was painted out directly on the original. Each stroke was filled from its
   own paper colour, so no generated pixels were used there.
4. `pixels changed outside the edit mask = 0`. Master: `Portfolio-illustration/animation/export/banner/hero-banner-outpaint-a1-clean.png`
   (sha256 `0dd6d623…6781d2`).

The renditions were re-encoded with the same settings as before. `hero-banner.webp` (`webp q86 effort 6 smartSubsample`) is **304,540 bytes**,
sha256 `6d757880d62bb309e5f1ae6cb6cec0fbd514724d33ecb3c0f34c33b116a98adf` (was 371,142). `hero-banner-mobile.webp` (same `extract`
box `640,0,1824×1344`) is **170,202 bytes**, sha256 `814d0b9b26d17edde1f0c242a1caf863c81c4bdbd48f1f135c6a9d6507bf8fc1` (was 210,964).

**Clip mask carve.** The clip (from `hero-desk`, which still carries its text) shows through the mask over parts of "The
journey. I enjoy.", the "Bigger horizons" caption, the laptop lid and the white mug. With the old mask, the clip therefore
painted fragments of the removed text back over the clean banner. `hero-clip-mask.png` now has feathered holes (alpha × (1 −
dilated text mask)) at those spots. Pixels where the clip actually moves (face, hand, pen, dog; frame range > 45/255) are excluded from the holes.
The video and poster files are unchanged. Result: 17,196 of 875,520 alpha values changed. The file was re-encoded exactly as before
(`sharp png({ palette: true, compressionLevel: 9, effort: 10 })`, which reproduces the old file byte-for-byte from the old alpha) and is **44,202 bytes**, sha256
`0af8d0ae0754b94956a91206bc0c7db756b82dc1a0388dbca2f7f887ab02b790` (was 38,998). The box and registration are unchanged.
