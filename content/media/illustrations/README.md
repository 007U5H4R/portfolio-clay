# Illustration provenance (Design.md §6.2; S20 — EVAL-021, EVAL-013)

One row per manifest id in `manifest.ts`. `sha256` is recorded for the two files that must stay
byte-identical to their disk source (`hero-desk` / the shipped hero poster, E-18); it is left as
"—" for entries where byte-exactness isn't a contract (the re-encoded scenes and the reference
sheet are derived renditions, not byte-exact copies). No further Higgsfield spend is approved
(Solution-PRD §12.4) — every row below reuses credits already spent at Stage 4.

## Re-encoding record (S73.01)

Scenes were re-encoded from the PNG masters in
`/Volumes/E Drive/Dev/Code/Claude/Portfolio-illustration/illustrations/scenes/` with `sharp`
(`jpeg({ quality: 82, mozjpeg: true })`, long edge 2048, no quality step-down needed — all six
landed under the 600 KB cap on the first pass):

| file | quality | bytes | dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scene-work.jpg` | 82 | 300,938 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-casestudy.jpg` | 82 | 437,320 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-about.jpg` | 82 | 350,979 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-thinking.jpg` | 82 | 516,249 | 2048×1529 |
| `scene-playground.jpg` | 82 | 404,203 | 2048×1360 |
| `scene-contact.jpg` | 82 | 431,849 | 1638×2048 |

The reference sheet was re-encoded from `character-ref-LOCKED.png` at quality 90 (no step-down
needed, 536,725 bytes, well under the 1.5 MB cap, 2688×1520).

## Manual per-asset checklist (Stage 8)

Filed separately at `evals/results/eval-021-<sha>.md` once Stage 8 runs: confirms per asset that it
depicts no metric, logo, product UI or claim (S20).
